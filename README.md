## Introducing 




Hello everyone,
This 2D Game I made while I had PRAO. Essentially In Sweden 9th graders have a apportunity to feel like grown-up person that works everyday. 
Im very interessted in to programming and stuff that are related to it, so I got best apportunity where I could work at the best place.

## Info




This project was made at the second day of my PRAO, every code, EVERYTHING is from a YouTube video. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Source




YouTube Video Link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ongc4EVqRjo&t=273s
This person is very good teacher and I appriciate his videos because he tells what does each code mean. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you can see in my .py project I have written comments under almost every code that I wrote. I did that so, I can understand what Im I doing and how does everything works. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As I wrote in my description, Im not fully done with my game because of the time, the times goes super fast and at the same time I need to learn. The game is done at the half way, so around 50%. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All the assets and music I took from the same video, so I just dont mess up with resolution or any other stuff that could destroy my project. If you want to know something more about the game/project look at his YouTube videos (He is more advanced). 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Outro





Maybe some of you are going to have some questions about why just PYTHON?
Python is a high skilled language that really can learn you alot. Python is special with that it allows you to learn stuff from it (Hope you understand what I mean). 

Yeah, that's it.
Bye, bye :)
